# Introduction to Algorithms
This repository contains notes from weekly introductory algorithmics classes held as part of the Algorithmics section. Mastering the material collected here should provide a solid foundation and intuition for further study of more advanced algorithmic topics, and should allow you to comfortably solve the algorithmic problems commonly seen in entry-level job interviews. A basic familiarity with algorithms and data structures is expected, but not required - if you’re missing some fundamentals, that’s fine, since the material is approachable enough to pick up the needed concepts along the way.
